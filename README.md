ROM Images

There are no ROM images delivered with Droid2600. But good news is that
there are many sources to download them.

Open Source
-----------

Droid2600 is based on the brilliant Stella multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator.
Stella was originally developed for Linux by Bradford W. Mott, and is currently
maintained by Stephen Anthony.

Thanks to the Stella team for the fantastic work!
